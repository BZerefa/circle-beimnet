        I was unengaged for most of the reading because it felt like a list of
        names and abbreviations for things I did not understand. What I found
        most interesting actually had nothing to do with the technology being
        developed, but the part that speaks to how <i>Engelbart’s lab</i> was
        set up. To paraphrase, he carefully considered the practical setup and
        social interactions within the <code>laboratory</code>, viewing it not
        only as a technological venture but also as a social experiment. The
        lab’s layout was unique for its time: while each person had a private
        office, the actual work took place in a shared "bullpen" area with
        movable terminals and open space.
        <strong>Engelbart believed</strong> this open layout encouraged
        communication, organizing the environment according to his idea of
        <cite>"social ergonomics."</cite> I think this was the key that points
        to the
        <b

            >connection between tech and social interaction not just after
            innovation but before,</code
          ></b
        >
        and as a catalyst for it as well. What do you think of this type of work
        space?

        I agree with the compelling nature of the <b>"bullpen"</b> envrionment
        that the engineers had to work in. The text described this space as
        <small>"exhilerating"</small> and <span>"maddening"</span> as I could
        only imagine it to be. I feel as though the moveable terminals was an
        innovative concept as it would <time>encourage movement</time> in a
        workspace that could be
        <i>stagnant as people were stuck to their computers.</i>
