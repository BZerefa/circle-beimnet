    <h1>Lake Tana Monasteries</h1>
    <p>
      Lake Tana, Bahir Dar has served as the spiritual heart of the Ethiopian
      Orthodox faith. Comprising 37 islands with 27 housing monasteries,
      churches, and the remnants of palaces, it holds immense historical
      significance as some of the oldest structures in the region.

    <h2>Memory</h2>
    <p>
      From when I was growing up in Ethiopia to whenever my family and I went
      back to visit, we always made a trip to the monasteries via boat and hike
      to pray and pay our respects to the churches. We went again this past
      summer and had the privilege of seeing the collection of religious
      paintings, clothing, and artifacts that the monasteries have preserved.
      The difference in the display, labeling, explanation, and overall
      atmosphere is indicative of how sacred the objects are and how they are
      meant to be seen. The pieces are found in two small rooms resting on the
      floor, hanging on the aged walls, encased by hand crafted furniture, and
      perched atop structures as old as the art itself. Their descriptions are
      written in Amharic first and foremost, with English translations below.
      The only guide is one of the people who resides at the monastery and
      narrates the extensive history behind each piece in Amharic. Without the
      use of glass cases and rigid organization seen in the MET, we could take a
      closer look at the art and have a deep appreciation for it while still
      respecting its placement. Additionally, access to the collection is free
      and any voluntary donations go directly to the people living there.
