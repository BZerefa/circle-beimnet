    <h1>Image</h1>
    <p>
      Although digital objects can be simple or complex, I chose to focus on a
      simple digital object made up of a single file; an image. In this short
      essay, I aim to conduct a formal analysis of both the metadata and
      informational content of an image I took. The digital object I have chosen
      is a photo of a necklace that appears to be composed of both metallic and
      brightly colored beadwork.
