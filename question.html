    <h1>Question</h1>
    <p>
      Write out one question (in the HTML file) for something that you want to
      learn in HTML, CSS or JS that will be helpful for your work on the final
      project. Push the page up and link it to your homepage. We will work
      together on Monday and Wednesday after the break to find possible
      solutions.

    <p>
      I think I will focus on liminal spaces that I've taken photos of for the
      final project so I would like to know more about animating images in CSS.
      I've started learning about that in my web design class and just want to
      see what more I can do with the images.
